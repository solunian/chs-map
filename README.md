## Dev Notes (Jun 20, 2023)
- idk if this was a waste of time or not
- I need to sleep more
- Svgs are a pain to figure out and to work with
- tailwind sometimes works against you, but mostly it's amazing
- Some of the styling I did with javascript seemed a bit hack-y; I hope it doesn't break
- vscode is giving me a ts error for importing CafeteriaF2, saying the file has no default export
- I don't want to touch this except for adding data
- please don't hardcode a bunch of stuff like I did; it's incredibly not fun
- qrcode to vercel link in the `resources/` folder

## Dev Notes (Jun 14, 2023)
- this is either gonna suck or be kinda cool
- i hope i can finish this in a couple days
- svgs are kinda cool but also kinda terrible to work with
- typescript is kinda cool when you're making the types yourself for data
